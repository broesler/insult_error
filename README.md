# Intentionally Insulting Exceptions for Python

This package provides a set of insulting exceptions you can use to make your
future self laugh, bother your collaborators, or both.

The basic approach is to subclass Exception with a silly name, but otherwise
preserve the expected functionality (e.g., allow for a useful message so that
using these exceptions doesn't make your code toooo much worse).

The various options are grouped loosely by a "rating" indicating the chances
you will offend someone (or yourself) by using them. You can raise specific 
exceptions directly, or raise one of the rating-level exceptions to get a
random class from that group. 

Please contribute! This package will be much more fun if not limited to the
measily initial set of options. Obviously, racist, sexist, or other bullshit
jokes are not welcome.

## Example

```python
